            <h1>Exertional Heat Illness: Overlooked Risk Factors</h1>
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            The year of 2023 was the hottest on record, which brings with it increased risks of heat 
            exposure for people around the world (NOAA; Périard et al., “Exercise under heat stress” 2). 
            Climate change is raising the temperature of the Earth, but awareness of the dangers of heat 
            exposure is not rising with it (“How to prevent”; Krohn et al. 1). Furthermore, prolonged heat 
            exposure can often lead to the development of a heat illness, especially in concurrence with 
            vigorous exercise (Périard et al., “Exertional heat stroke” 1). There are many different factors 
            that play into an individual’s susceptibility to heat illnesses, but one that is not often discussed is 
            para-athlete status. Individuals with paralytic impairments may have decreased ability to 
            thermoregulate (Alkemade et al. 1), which thereby increases the risk of heat illness in this 
            demographic. However, among all types of athletes, heat illness is a topic that is often allowed to 
            go by the wayside. Exertional heat illness is a serious concern for athletes (especially 
            para-athletes), and they should be more educated on causes, risk factors, and prevention 
            strategies in order to actively prevent such an affliction.
            <h2>2. Earliest Findings</h2> 
            30 years ago, heat illness was even more of an obscure issue. The heat-related death rate 
            peaked in 1999 at a staggering 587 deaths (“Climate Change Indicators”; “National 
            Environmental”), which prompted efforts to reduce athletes’ risk of developing exertional heat 
            stroke (EHS) throughout the 2000’s. The following decade is when many studies began to be 
            published on the causes and treatment of heat illnesses. For example, a study published by the 
            American Journal of Sports Medicine in 2007 suggests that “[exertional] heat illness is generally 
            the result of increased heat production and impaired dissipation of heat,” and that “[it] should be 
            treated aggressively to avoid life-threatening complications”. At that time, EHS was the third 
            leading cause of death in athletes behind cardiac disorders and head/neck trauma. These studies 
            also gathered information on the myriad of causes that exist for the development of heat illness. 
            Over a dozen types of medications were found to increase risk, as well as medical conditions 
            such as sickle cell anemia, dehydration, sleep deprivation, sunburn, and obesity (Howe & 
            Boden). These inherent qualities were beneficial to identifying high-risk individuals and 
            subsequently providing them with better protection against EHS. <br><br>
            However, paralysis is a medical condition that has largely flown under the radar of 
            exertional heat illness (EHI) studies, only recently gaining attention ahead of the 2020 Olympic 
            games in Tokyo. Studies emerged as early as the 1990’s on thermoregulation in paralyzed 
            individuals, independent of the studies on EHI. They found that “individuals with quadriplegia 
            [(paralysis of all four limbs)] had the poorest tolerance to heat” (Yamasaki et al. 1). Nonetheless, 
            paralysis was never directly linked to greater risk of EHI until 2019, when “the [wet bulb globe 
            temperature (WBGT)] 2 weeks prior to the [2020 Olympic] games at the hottest moment of the 
            day (13:00 h) [was] 26.4±2.9°C and 28.6±2.8°C during the games.” This would have been the 
            hottest Olympics on record, and the Paralympics would be doomed to the same fate. The same 
            study states that at merely “18.4–22.2°C” there is an increased “risk of exertional heat stroke and 
            heat illness,” and recommends that “high risk individuals should be monitored or not compete.” 
            22°C is already a risky temperature for athletes to compete, let alone at temperatures higher than 
            28°C. Acknowledging the risk factor for paralyzed athletes, the researchers note that the heat 
            would “impose considerable heat strain” on the Paralympic athletes since they “often have a 
            reduced ability to thermoregulate.” (Gerrett et al. 1-3).
            <h2>3. Environmental Causes</h2>
            While medications and medical conditions are noted as “internal factors” in the onset of 
            heat illness, there also exist “external factors” pertaining to the environment. In fact, as 
            researchers have looked farther into the epidemiology of EHI in more recent years, one’s 
            environment is often the most significant determinant of risk of EHI. A research paper written by 
            Julien Périard, a professor at the University of Canberra Research Institute for Sport and 
            Exercise and expert on EHI, found that increased ambient temperature, high humidity, low 
            winds, and insulating clothing can all increase risk of people in such an environment developing 
            a heat illness  (Périard et al., “Exercise under heat stress” 3-6). This translates into an even higher 
            risk for athletes to develop EHI, combining a sub-optimal environment with high physical 
            exertion. Para-athletes are at an even greater risk in conditions such as these, as they have a 
            lessened ability to maintain their body temperature even in mild climates (Alkemade et al 1). 
            Périard also asserts that overall athletic performance is hindered by these external factors, with 
            heat causing fatigue and increased perspiration rates, which only increases strain to maintain a 
            normal body temperature (Périard at. al., “Exercise under heat stress” 3). Furthermore, a separate 
            study led by Périard listed uniforms as an environmental cause of EHI, as they can “potentially 
            impede skin surface heat dissipation” (Périard et al., “Exertional heat stroke” 2). Heat dissipation 
            is paramount in maintaining a safe core temperature, and so any obstruction to this process can 
            be cause for concern regarding the vulnerability to EHI. All of these factors directly contribute to 
            high core temperature in athletes, as opposed to the predispository nature of internal factors.<br><br>
            Yet another determinant that can magnify the threat of heat illness is the environment that 
            one’s body is accustomed to. Environments can be adapted to by either acclimation (artificial 
            adaptation) or acclimatization (natural adaptation), both of which typically entail training and 
            spending time in an environment with a similar temperature and humidity level to the target 
            environment. Failure to acclimate to one’s environment can greatly increase fatigue and risk of 
            EHI/EHS in athletes. A study done by Périard in 2015 has shown that it takes approximately 5 
            days in an unfamiliar environment to fully acclimate to it, at which point 0% of subjects 
            experienced heat syncope during vigorous exercise. This is a significant improvement over the 
            44% of subjects that experienced such symptoms after the same intensity of exercise and only 
            one day of acclimatization (Périard et al., “Adaptations and mechanisms” 6). These results 
            confirm that athletes need to condition their body to work efficiently in the competition 
            environment, and not doing so can lead to harmful results such as heat syncope. In addition to 
            this, several other studies have concluded that lack of heat acclimation/acclimatization is 
            correlated with lower blood flow rates to crucial parts of the body, most notably, the skin. It is 
            also known to cause increased perspiration in response to thermal strain (Périard et al., “Exercise 
            under heat stress” 45; Périard et al., “Adaptations and mechanisms” 7; Gerrett et al. 1-10), which 
            only decreases hydration levels as well as overall heat dissipation from the body. Greater skin 
            temperature and decreased heat dissipation are textbook causes of EHI, so these circumstances 
            should be avoided at all costs. Dehydration is also known to weaken thermoregulation (Périard et 
            al., “Exertional heat stroke” 4; Périard et al., “Exercise under heat stress” 40-41), so athletes’ 
            acclimation to their environment is crucial to maximize performance while minimizing fatigue 
            and susceptibility to EHI. 

            <h2>4. Mitigation Strategies</h2> 
            Much of the earlier research on this topic described the stages of heat illness as a 
            continuum, and most prescribed simply “aggressive cooling” as treatment (Howe & Boden; 
            Périard et al., “Exertional heat stroke”; Périard et al., “Exercise under heat stress” 1; Krohn et al. 
            1-9). However, as more research has been done on this topic, it appears that it is not enough to 
            simply treat exertional heat illness, and that prevention is far more effective at reducing the 
            overall number of EHI incidents, and most importantly, decreasing fatalities due to EHS. 
            As with causes, methods proven to have a significant impact on likelihood of a patient to 
            develop an EHI were largely consistent across studies. The most often mentioned methods were 
            ensuring hydration, rest, and prior acclimatization. This means athletes should train in the 
            competition environment for at least 5 days prior to the event, gradually increasing the amount of 
            equipment worn, as some uniforms (e.g., football) may be more insulating than others (Krohn et 
            al.; Howe & Boden 7). Additionally, athletes must consistently drink water throughout the event, 
            even if they do not perceive thirst, as “ad libitum [(as needed)] water intake can result in 
            incomplete fluid replacement or voluntary dehydration during exercise heat stress...” (Périard et 
            al., “Adaptations and mechanisms” 5). Athletes cannot purely rely on thirst levels to hydrate 
            themselves, and must do so proactively to maintain a strong thermoregulatory system during 
            exercise. This ensures adequate blood flow performance and thus builds stronger resistance to 
            EHI/EHS. In regards to rest, Périard suggests “mandated work-to-rest ratios,” but having had 
            adequate sleep the night before is arguably more important in reducing fatigue and thereby 
            thermal strain. One can have many breaks during exercise, but if they slept for an insufficient 
            amount of time the night before, they will be tired and fatigued no matter what. Rest must be 
            combined with hydration and acclimatization to actively prevent the onset of EHI. 
            <h2>5. Limitations</h2>
            These strategies have been proven to be effective in mitigating EHI risk, but they can be 
            unfeasible in certain situations. For instance, it may not always be possible for athletes to 
            acclimate to the environment, as the conditions may not allow for it. As previously mentioned, 
            this occurred before the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, which was the main contributor to the 78 
            athletes that developed EHI during the games, even with extra precautions in place (Soligard et 
            al.). Moreover, athletes that travel often are at risk because they simply do not spend enough time 
            in each location to become properly acclimated. For athlete rest time, the amount of rest that can 
            viably be offered during exercise may be limited by the sport in question, and it is difficult to 
            mandate a bed time to ensure adequate sleep as well. These things can impede the prevention of 
            EHI through the methods listed. <br><br>
            Simultaneously, limitations concerning treatment of EHI also exist. Typically, a cold bath 
            is prescribed to reduce core temperature (Howe & Boden 7; Hosokawa et al. 3-4), but this is not 
            always possible or trivial to provide. Thick pads such as those used in football can greatly 
            obstruct the administration of care, especially in an instance of EHS, where the athlete may not 
            be able to take it off themselves. Treating para-athletes gives rise to an entirely new set of 
            challenges, mainly due to the lack of resources and studies on EHI/EHS treatment specific to 
            their condition (Fukuhara et al. 1-2). The typical cold bath technique may not be convenient 
            when an athlete is in a wheelchair, and may require a team of people to coordinate. Additionally, 
            some athletes with mental impairments may not be cooperative in efforts to cool them down via 
            cold bath (Hosokawa et al. 2-4). Thus, prevention is the most consequential measure to take 
            against exertional heat illness in para-athletes. 

            <h2>6. Athlete Mentality and Awareness</h2>
            Toxic mentalities among athletes also hamper EHI prevention, and can indirectly increase 
            risk by decreasing hydration. It was stated previously that ad libitum water intake is not 
            sufficient to maintain adequate hydration during exercise, and this is due to a multitude of 
            factors. It seems that athletes aren’t taking advantage of their opportunities to maintain their 
            hydration and temperature as much as they need to be. As sports medicine professor Austin 
            Krohn reports in a research paper, “even with increased efforts in promoting education and 
            hydration, the incidence of death from exertional heat stroke continues to rise” (Krohn et al. 1). 
            The answer as to why likely has to do with athlete mentality and stoicism. A study published by 
            Malvin Janal, a Health Research Specialist at NYU, observed the perception of pain among 
            athletes during exercise under different adverse conditions. He discovered that, when he 
            “evaluated the effects of exercise on innocuous as well as noxious intensities of heat and 
            ischaemia[,] [exercise] diminished the perception of painful but not non-painful levels of heat” 
            (Janal 2). As a result, athletes may not realize that they are experiencing hyperthermic 
            (excessively high body temperature) symptoms, and possibly developing EHI. If an athlete does 
            not realize that they are experiencing such symptoms, they are likely to continue play when they 
            should be taking a break and/or hydrating. Thus, athlete awareness of their condition is essential 
            to the prevention of EHI. However, even when athletes are aware of the heat stress they are 
            under, they may continue to play in spite of this, often because of internal pressures to perform 
            well. Périard agrees with Janal, asserting that the high levels of motivation and exertion seen in 
            professional sport can inhibit natural responses to hyperthermia (Périard et al., “Exertional heat 
            stroke” 2). This abnormal ignorance to heat stress can cause escalation of EHI in athletes, and 
            can potentially lead to life threatening consequences. Therefore, athletes must be fully aware of 
            their cooling and hydration needs, and be consistent with employment of prevention strategies to 
            mitigate risk of EHI during play. 
            <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
            In sum, exertional heat illness and exertional heat stroke are extremely serious and 
            prevalent ailments incurred by athletes, and there are many risk factors associated with 
            vulnerability to them. Para-athletes are at an increased risk under all circumstances due to their 
            impaired thermoregulatory system, and should take extra precautions to avoid EHI/EHS 
            development. Para-athletes also introduce complications to the treatment process, and so their 
            condition exponentially decreases their ability to both prevent and treat EHI/EHS. Athletes, and 
            especially para-athletes need to be fully aware of the dangers of these illnesses, and be educated 
            on the correct steps to take to curtail risk. This education combined with increased opportunities 
            for rest, hydration, and cooling for athletes at sporting events can keep heat-related illnesses and 
            deaths to a minimum. <br><br>
