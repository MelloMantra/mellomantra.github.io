        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>I have been making music since I first learned to play piano at age 5. I enjoyed playing, but composing was always more alluring. I would write sheet music in a little book my mom got me. GarageBand was my first experience with an actual DAW, after randomly discovering it while bored on a road trip. I played around with the loops for a while, since it was impossible to make them sound bad, but eventually I accepted that I had to get back to actual composing to create original songs. Using premade loops and samples has always felt like cheating to me. So every note you hear was played by me on my Arturia MiniLab MKII. Occasionally I'll use a downloaded sound effect but thats about the extent of my "sampling".</p>
        <p>The genre of music I create changes with the seasons. In the past I have experimented with EDM, Techno, LoFi, and Neoclassical, but those are not necessarily indicators of where my next project will go. I'm currently working on a neoclassical EP (coming soon!).</p>
        <p>I'm inspired by people like Rick Rubin, creating art through some sort of divine connection. I resonate with the idea that by just playing your instrument of choice and jamming, soloing until you hit a groove, is like being in sync with some higher being. I long for that transcendental feeling. Eyes closed, fingers moving as if possessed, pouring your heart onto your piano, it's truly an out of body experience. And then, as swiftly as it entered, the higher forces dissipate as you open your eyes.</p>
